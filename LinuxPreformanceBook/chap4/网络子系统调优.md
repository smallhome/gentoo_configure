# Tuning the operating system

Linux distributions and the Linux kernel offer a variety of parameters and settings to let the
Linux administrator tweak the system to maximize performance. As stated earlier in this
paper, there is no magic tuning knob that will improve systems performance for any
application. The settings discussed in the following chapter will improve performance for
certain hardware configurations and application layouts. The settings that improve
performance for a Web server scenario might have adverse impacts on the performance of a
database system.

This chapter describes the steps you can take to tune kernel 2.6 based Linux distributions.
Since the current kernel 2.6 based distributions vary from kernel release 2.6.9 up to 2.6.19 (at
the time of this paper) some tuning options might only apply to a specific kernel release. The
objective is to describe the parameters that give you the most improvement in performance
and offer a basic understanding of the techniques that are used in Linux, including:

Linux memory management

System clean up

Disk subsystem tuning

Kernel tuning using sysctl

Network optimization

This chapter has the following sections:

4.1, “Tuning principles”
4.2, “Installation considerations”
4.3, “Changing kernel parameters”
4.4, “Tuning the processor subsystem”
4.5, “Tuning the vm subsystem”
4.6, “Tuning the disk subsystem”
4.7, “Tuning the network subsystem”
